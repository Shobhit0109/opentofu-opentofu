# Migrating to OpenTofu from Terraform

OpenTofu is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Terraform, maintaining compatibility with Terraform's configuration language and state files. This means that in most cases, migrating from Terraform to OpenTofu is straightforward.

## Before you begin

OpenTofu aims to maintain compatibility with Terraform configurations. While most Terraform code will work without modification, we recommend following our [migration guide](migration-guide) to ensure a smooth transition.

## Migration process

The migration process is designed to be safe and reversible:

1. **Back up your infrastructure state and code**
2. **Install OpenTofu**
3. **Initialize and verify your configuration**
4. **Test with a small change**
